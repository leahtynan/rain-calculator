This interactive explores an artistic form of data visualization. The user changes the dimensions of a cloud to see how much it will rain. The application has data about the average rainfall for areas in the US with different kinds of ecosystems. When the gallon and cup estimation is generated, it is compared to the rainfall data for the selected location.  

Artwork by Ruth Compton, rainfall data from timeanddate.com, audio recorded on my back yard and front porch.
